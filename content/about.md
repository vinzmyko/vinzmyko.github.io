Backend engineer based in Farnborough, Hampshire. I build systems that connect people: APIs, infrastructure, the behind-the-scenes work that makes things actually function.

Currently open to freelance and full-time opportunities, and flexible on location.

### How I work

I focus on what matters. If I'm prototyping a system, I'm not building a full authentication flow when I haven't validated the core functionality yet. I prioritise ruthlessly: understand the problem first, then work on the parts that actually move things forward.

I'm also transparent. I'll explain the tradeoffs, give you the information, and let you make the decision.
